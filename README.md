这是我在香港城市大学学习 Msc Computer Science项目时所选课程的所有自行整理的复习资料。
Here is the self-compiled review material for all the courses I took during my Msc Computer Science program at the City University of Hong Kong.

所有文档都是根据课程PPT进行整理，其中可能加入了部分本人理解（不保证正确），其内容详尽程度应该可以覆盖期末考试的绝大部分内容。
All documents are organized based on course PPTs, with some personal interpretations added (correctness is not guaranteed). The content is detailed enough to cover most of the final exam scope.

但这并不意味着期末复习时只参考这些复习文档就可以高枕无忧，阅读复习文档时若产生疑问，请自行google或询问AI。 
However, this does not mean that relying solely on these review documents for final exam preparation is sufficient. If any questions arise while reading, please conduct independent research via Google or consult an AI.

请注意，课程内容可能具有时效性，若文档中内容与你正在学习的内容有所出入，请自行甄别并以你的目前内容为准。
Please note that the course content may be time-sensitive. If there is any discrepancy between the content in the documents and what you are currently learning, please independently verify and refer to your current materials as the standard.
